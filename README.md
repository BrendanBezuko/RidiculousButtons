# Ridiculous Buttons

A collection of buttons compatible with the Nuxt framework. This project is a work in progress. I aim to add a large collection of unique and animated buttons free for use with attribution and link to this repo somewhere on the webpage.

Clone this repo and run locally or vist https://brendanbezuko.github.io/RidiculousButtons/

## Features

- **Light and dark mode**: Every button will be compatible with color-mode Nuxt module.
- **Every Button will exist as a SFC**: A beautiful about vue is the components can exist as a single file. Every button can easily be used by simply copying the SFC (clicking the button). N.b. Though these buttons are SFCs, I'm not going to guarantee vue compatibility (Nuxt is recommended)).
- **Easily copy the SFCs**: The built-in preprocessor parses the SFCs and allows you to run the development server, pick a button, press it, and the entire SFC including HTML, SASS, and javascript will be in your clipboard ready to go.

## Philosophy

I'm not a professional designer, but I do believe everyone should participate in designs because it keeps things interesting with different perspectives. Design work is quite difficult and takes time to refine and get good designs, so expect these buttons to undergo a lot of refining as I develop this repo with better more nuanced design, features, and animations.
